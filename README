forma is a form customization jQuery plug-in.
forma customize form elements with image "PNG" backgrounds.
I developed it to use on my Uygulama project new version.

I've only tested it on 
  * Chromium (14.0.835.202), 
  * Google Chrome (15.0.874.120), 
  * Mozilla Firefox (3.6.17), 
  * Opera (11.52) 
and it works enough for me for now!
